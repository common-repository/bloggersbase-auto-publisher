== Description ==

Participating in the BloggersBase Competition Blogs helps you get discovered, promotes your posts and your name and increases your overall exposure.

The competitions is based on multi-authored blogs, each focusing on a specific topic, for example, Gadgets and Mobile, Politics and Opinions, etc. You get a chance to publish one post a week in the blog you find most fitting your interests and are exposed to a large audience that reads and rates your post. If your post is rated high, you will be promoted to the most visible section of that topic blog and have the privilege to publish as many posts as you like during that week.
